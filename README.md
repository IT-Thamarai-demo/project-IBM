# Water Quality Analysis with Python - IBM Project

Welcome to the Water Quality Analysis project, developed using Python and IBM technologies. This project is designed to analyze and manage water quality data, providing insights into various metrics using advanced data management and analysis techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: To analyze water quality data and provide actionable insights using IBM technologies and Python.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, IBM Watson, IBM Cloud (if applicable), Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Sources**: Includes datasets related to water quality metrics such as pH, turbidity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Load and preprocess water quality datasets.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis and apply IBM analytics tools if integrated.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to understand water quality trends.
- **Reporting**: Generate and export reports based on analysis findings.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python is installed. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).
